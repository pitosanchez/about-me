      <section>
        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          I am a 57-year-old Puerto Rican writer, advocate, and visionary from
          Spanish Harlem who has lived through the fault lines of a health
          system that too often leaves Black and Brown people behind. After
          receiving a kidney transplant in 2020, I turned my personal fight for
          survival into a lifelong mission: transforming how our communities
          access kidney care, transplant pathways, and the dignity we deserve in
          medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
          My lived experience — incarceration, chronic illness, navigating
          structural racism, rebuilding my life from the ground up — fuels every
          part of the work I do today. I’ve learned that healing is not just
          personal; it’s systemic. It demands truth-telling, design, advocacy,
          and a refusal to accept inequity as normal.
        </p>

      <!-- SECTION: WHAT I DO NOW -->
      <section>
        <h2>The Work I Do</h2>
        <p>
          I am the founder of <strong>Kidney Forward</strong> and
          <strong>The Jentosy Project</strong>, two community-driven initiatives
          reshaping kidney transplant access for people of color. My work
          bridges community voices with medical institutions, pushing for
          systems that respect, protect, and uplift those most harmed by
          inequity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I serve on advisory committees, research boards, and national
          collaborations focused on rare kidney disease, clinical research, and
          health equity. Whether developing programs, writing commentary,
          supporting research design, or speaking to audiences, I bring one
          purpose: build systems where people like me are no longer forced to
          fight alone.
        </p>

      <!-- SECTION: WHY I CODE -->
      <section>
        <h2>Why I’m Learning to Code</h2>
        <p>
          My coding journey began with a simple belief: technology should serve
          the communities most affected by injustice. As I build digital tools,
          websites, data systems, and storytelling platforms, I’m creating
          infrastructure for advocacy, education, and patient empowerment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through The Odin Project and Onramp F25, I’m expanding my engineering
          skills so I can design and deploy digital spaces that are accessible,
          medically accurate, and culturally grounded. Coding is not a hobby for
          me — it’s another way to break down barriers in medicine and make
          knowledge accessible to the people who need it most.
